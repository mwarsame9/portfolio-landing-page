# Portfolio Landing Page

#### By Mohamed Warsame

## Description

On this website I talk about me, what my interests are and a brief background. I use panels on my page. I have a picture of me floating on the left and then an "About Me" paragraph on its right. I use many links to link to the webpages I have designed so far using their github urls.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* I started with empty page
* Then I created my code using HTML then CSS and Bootsrtap
* I used panels rows and columns, and containers
* I committed throughout
* Finally I created a gh-pages so it can be viewed online
