                <p>My name is Mohamed Warsame. I live in Hillsboro, Oregon. I have recently started coding. <em>I really enjoy it and cannot wait to learn more</em>! I graduated from Bentley University in Waltham Massachusetts in 2013 with a degree in Managerial Economics. After graduating, I moved to Nothern Virgnia in the Washington, DC area. I lived there for 3 years before relocating to Oregon last summer. I really love it out here and hope to stay for a long time. Thank you for reading about me.
